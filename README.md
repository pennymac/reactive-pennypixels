# Unoffcial Reactive PennyPixels

This is a starter project for React programmers working at PennyMac.

1.  [PennyPixels](http://pennypixels.pennymacusa.com/#navs) (Because you "should" be using it)
2.  [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) (Because it is awesome)
3.  [Babel Hot Loader](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/) (Because we automate common work)
4.  [Webpack dev server](http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html) (If you want live code editing)
5.  [Cucumber-js to automate testing](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) (Or substitute another test approach)

To get started clone the repo, delete the .git folder and start a new program.
